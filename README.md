# mastermind

This project involves creating a text-based version of the game Mastermind.
It allows the player to either supply a "code" for the computer to crack or for the computer
to randomly generate a code for you to crack! It will give clues along the way according to the rules
of Mastermind. It demonstrates OOP for Ruby with lots of logic and operating on instance vs class
variables.
